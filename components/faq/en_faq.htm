            <p class="mb-1"><strong>Q: Are you guys an official tournament run by Final Fantasy XIV like the Feast
                Regional Championships?</strong></p>
            <p>A: No, The Feast World Cup is a community-run tournament hosted by PvPaissa.</p>

            <p class="mb-1"><strong>Q: Do I need to make a character on all 3 data centers for the whole
                tournament?</strong></p>
            <p>A: No, you only need 1 character on the region you will be starting the tournament in. If your team
                qualifies for <em>The Feast World Cup</em> main event from the Regional Qualifiers, you will be given
                2 weeks to make characters on other regional data centers. Specifically for <strong>Europe</strong>
                and <strong>Japan PvP teams</strong> that qualify for The Feast World Cup Main Event, they will only
                have to create <strong>1 additional character on the <u>Aether</u> Datacenter</strong> if their teams
                qualify.</p>

            <p class="mb-1"><strong>Q: Ping seems unfair for certain teams coming from certain regions, how will you
                balance this?</strong></p>
            <p>A: All games in The Feast World Cup main event are a best-of-3 (BO3) with the exception of the Grand
                Finals (BO5). For <strong><u>NA vs JP</u></strong> and <strong><u>NA vs EU</u></strong> match-ups, these
                matches will be played on each other’s respective data centers (ex. Game 1 played on Aether and Game 2
                played on Chaos. <u>Game 3 will be decided by a /random in-game where the team that rolls the highest
                    number will have the game played on their home data center</u>). For <strong><u>EU vs
                    JP</u></strong> match-ups specifically--due to severe ping issues going both ways--we have decided
                it would be most fair for both teams to have all matches played on the North American Data Center
                (Aether).</p>

            <p class="mb-1"><strong>Q: I want to participate in The Feast World Cup but I only have a character on Gaia
                / Elemental / Primal. How can I participate?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Data center selection for this tournament was thought out carefully and it was determined that Aether,
                Chaos and Mana are the most populated data centers for the majority of PvP players. If you want to
                participate in the tournament, you will have to create a character on one of these data centers.</p>

            <p class="mb-1"><strong>Q: What are all the prizes I can potentially win?</strong></p>
            <p>A: For the Regional Qualifiers, 1st place team in each region will receive a free character or story
                boost of their choice for every member on their team.</p>
            <p>For winning <em>The Feast World Cup</em>: Main Event, a Trophy and a minimum $2,000 USD + <a
                    href="/world-cup/contribute">extra crowd-funded prize pool</a> will be won by <em>The Feast World
                    Cup</em> Winners.</p>
            <hr>

            <p class="mb-1"><strong>Q: Is there a way for me to contribute to the prizes other than monetary
                means?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes! We are open to suggestions for all potential types of prizes. If you want to contribute through
                other means, please email us at <a href="mailto:pvpaissa@gmail.com">pvpaissa@gmail.com</a>.</p>

            <p class="mb-1"><strong>Q: My team and I want to participate but we can only make it certain days of the
                tournament. Is scheduling flexible?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Unfortunately, the dates for the tournament are set in stone, but the time within the scheduled day is
                flexible to change within the allocated time blocks. If there are time accomodations/restrictions you
                wish to request, please contact one of the Regional Representatives or Staff as soon as possible.</p>

            <p class="mb-1"><strong>Q: Why is the format of “The Feast World Cup: Main Event - Group Stage”
                changed?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We changed the “2 Groups of 6 Teams” format to “4 Groups of 3 Teams” format to minimize the number of
                games that is needed to schedule by each team from 5 BO3 matches to 2 BO3 games per team. Since time
                zones significantly impact availability, we have decided to make this change.</p>
            <hr>

            <p class="mb-1"><strong>Q: Why is Game 3 for <u>NA vs EU</u> and <u>NA vs JP</u> games decided by a /random
                in-game?</strong></p>
            <p>A: This was a tricky decision for us to make. Given our options, we could either decide the tie-breaker
                game through completely random means (i.e. /random, coin flip, etc.) or give the higher seeded team the
                home-data center advantage in the match-up (i.e. NA#1 vs EU#2, Game 3 would be played on NA because of
                higher seeding). However, the “advantage to higher seeding” method forces us to decide the tie-breaker
                matches with “completely random means” for equally-seeded team matches (NA#2 vs EU#2). After carefully
                weighing our options, we have decided that it would be best to let “/random” in-game decide the
                datacenter of choice for game 3 for only <u>NA vs EU</u> and <u>NA vs JP</u> matches, ONLY IF the
                series reaches to a game 3 in a BO3, or a game 5 in a BO5. Keep in mind that <u>EU vs JP</u> matches
                are all played on the Aether Data Center, regardless of reaching a tie-breaker game or not.</p>
