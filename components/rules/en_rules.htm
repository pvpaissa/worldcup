                            and Game 2 will be played on Aether. Game 3 will be decided by a /random.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If there is evidence of teams practicing misconduct (i.e. wintrading, boosting, etc.) during the

                        <li>If medals are still tied, a best-of-1 rematch will be played between the teams that are
                            tied.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Network issues are the sole responsibility of the individual players.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If a disconnect happens mid-game:
                            <ul>
                                <li>If the disconnection happened between six (6) to five (5) minutes left on the

                                <li>If the disconnection happened after the five (5) minute left mark on the match,
                                    the match will be played on.</li>

                <li>
                    In the case of a server-wide or data center-wide network issue, a rematch will be played
                    regardless, or postponed until the network issues have been alleviated.
                </li>
                <li id="ping-issues"><strong>In The Feast World Cup: Main Event</strong>, qualified teams will play in

                        <li>To combat ping issues, all "Europe vs. Japan" matches will be played on Aether.</li>
                        <li>
                            Because EU ping to Mana Datacenter and JP ping to Chaos Datacenter is higher than both EU
                            and JP ping to Aether Datacenter, we have decided it would be best to make this change.

                </li>

                    Best-of-5, the Datacenter that this match will be played on will be decided by a /random in-game
                    between the two team leaders or sub-leaders. The team that rolls the highest /random number in-game
                    will have the match played on the winning team's data center. All potential BO3 and BO5 matches for
                    EU vs JP will be played on Aether.</li>
